### 🌱 Must-haves
- Generate a secret number between 1 and  the number of learners in the class
- A user can enter a guess (what html element can be useful for this?)
- Compare the number to the secrete number when the user pushes the "play" button
- Depending on the outcome, an alert box will show:
    - Awesome! You number (actual number) was correct. You can be named many things, hungry not being one of them.
    - Bummer... You guessed (guess) and the secret number was (secret number).
    
### 🌻 Nice-to-haves
When a guess was just one number from the secret number, show another message: "So close, but you just missed it! Are you in a class that started on the thirteenth or what?"
